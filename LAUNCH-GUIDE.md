## 🎯 Weekend Goals

To make this launch successful:

1. **Deploy by Friday afternoon** (Feb 14)
2. **Share on social media** Friday evening
3. **Send email to existing list** Friday night or Saturday morning
4. **Get 50+ installs** by Sunday night
5. **Collect feedback** for v2

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these after launch:

- **Installs:** How many people "Add to Home Screen"?
- **Completions:** How many finish onboarding?
- **Share rate:** How many use the share button?
- **Return rate:** How many come back for a 2nd activity?
- **Feedback:** What do parents say?

## 🐛 Known Limitations

For transparency:

1. **Icons are placeholders** - Works fine, but you could create better custom icons
2. **No backend** - Everything is client-side (localStorage)
3. **No user accounts** - Can't sync across devices
4. **Share image** - Currently just text (could generate actual images in v2)
5. **Activity completion** - Not tracked (could add badges in v2)

All of these are fine for a v1 launch! Ship it and iterate based on feedback.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Right Now)

1. **Test locally** - Open `index.html` and verify everything works
2. **Deploy** - Run `./deploy.sh` or use Netlify Drop
3. **Test on mobile** - Install on your phone
4. **Share** - Post on social media
5. **Gather feedback** - Ask families to try it this weekend

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Everything is built. Everything works. It's Valentine's/President's Day weekend.

Time to **launch** and make some family memories! 💕
