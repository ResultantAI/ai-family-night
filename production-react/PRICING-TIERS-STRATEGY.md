- **5/6 would pay $9.99/month** = Product-Market Fit ✅

### Skeptics Panel (3 "Hard Sell" Participants):
- **Willow (Crunchy Mom)**: NO subscriptions, would buy physical kit
- **Frank (Frugal Dad)**: "$9.99 is steep. Would do $2.99/mo with ads OR one-time $5 per game"

## 🚨 Pricing Psychology Best Practices

### 1. Anchor High, Discount Smart
**DON'T:** Show $9.99 alone
**DO:** Show $119.88/year crossed out → $59/year (Save 50%)

### 2. Default to Yearly
**DON'T:** Default to monthly billing
**DO:** Pre-select yearly toggle, show savings prominently

### 3. Social Proof
**DON'T:** Generic "Join now"
**DO:** "Join 1,200+ families" (update number monthly)

### 4. Urgency (but not pushy)
**DON'T:** "Limited time offer!"
**DO:** "Price locks in when you subscribe - we never raise rates for existing members"

### 5. Free Trial No-Brainer
**DON'T:** Ask for credit card upfront
**DO:** 7-day free trial, no credit card required

## 🔍 FAQ - Pricing Objections Handled

### "Why should I pay when there are free alternatives?"

**Answer:** Free apps are either:
1. Ad-filled (your kids see toy commercials)
2. Low-quality (template-based, not AI-powered)
3. Solo play (not family bonding)
4. Data harvesting (we never sell your info)

We're the only app where **parents actually enjoy playing too**. That's worth $9.99.

---

### "My kid will get bored after 2 weeks"

**Answer:** We release a **new game every Sunday**. 52 games/year.

If Netflix is worth $15.99/month for passive watching, we're worth $9.99 for **active family time**.

Plus: No commitment. Cancel anytime.

---

### "Can I try before I buy?"

**Answer:** YES! 7-day free trial, no credit card required.

We're so confident you'll love it, we don't even ask for payment info upfront.

---

### "I'm anti-subscription"

**Answer:** We hear you! Two options:
1. **Yearly plan ($59)** - pay once, forget for 12 months
2. **Gift subscription** - someone else pays, you enjoy

We're building single-game purchases too (coming Q3 2026).
