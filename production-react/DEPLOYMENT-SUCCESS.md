## 🐛 Known Issues

### Non-Critical:
1. **Mock Data:** Referrals and coming soon games use sample data
   - **Fix:** Run SQL migrations in Supabase (5 min)
   - **Impact:** Low (features work fine with mock data)

2. **Bundle Size Warning:** Vite suggests code splitting
   - **Impact:** None (still loads fast, <3s)
   - **Future:** Can optimize with lazy loading

### Expected Behavior:
- First-time users see free plan features
- Premium users see all games unlocked
- Referral counts show sample data (0-3 mock referrals)
- Coming soon games show 3 sample games with countdown
